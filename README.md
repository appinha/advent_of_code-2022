## 🗣️ About

(TODO: write)

## 🌟 What is *Advent of Code*?

	🚀 TLDR: an online event where a two-part programming puzzle is released each day from Dec 1st to the 25th.

[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) is an online event created by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/). In his words:

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

## 📑 Contents

❗️ **Important:** This repo was created from the template [advent_of_code-template](https://github.com/appinha/advent_of_code-template), please refer to its documentation for more information.

My solutions for the puzzles are available in the folder [📁 my_solutions](my_solutions) and are organized into subfolders for each day of the event.

Inside each subfolder, the following files can be found:

* `input_test.txt` - contains input from tests given in the puzzle.
* `input.txt` - contains my personal input for the puzzle.
* `main.py` - Python code for solving the puzzle.
* `README.md` - contains a tldr of the puzzle.
* `solutions.txt` - contains the solutions to my inputs for the puzzle.

## 🛠️ Usage

### Requirements

- `Python 3.10`
- `termcolor`
