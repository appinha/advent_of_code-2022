## 🗣️ About

(TODO: write)

## 🌟 What is *Advent of Code*?

	🚀 TLDR: an online event where a two-part programming puzzle is released each day from Dec 1st to the 25th.

[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) is an online event created by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/). In his words:

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.
